# 🎵 MoodTunes
MoodTunes is a real-time music recommendation service designed to deliver personalized music based on your current activity or situation. Instead of relying on user history or preferences, MoodTunes uses speech inputs to understand the user's current emotional and situational context, providing music that fits the moment—whether you're studying, exercising, traveling, or dealing with a breakup.  

## 🚀 Key Features
> - **Emotion Analysis**   
>   : User input is processed using a combination of STT and LLM to extract emotion and context tags.
> - **Context-Aware Recommendations**   
>   : Based on the extracted tags, a content-based filtering approach is used to match the user’s current context with relevant songs from a curated database.
> - **Real-time Recommendations**    
>   : Recommendations are generated on-the-fly based on live input.
